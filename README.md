# GWL - Generic Windowing Library
GWL focuses on high versatility, one example of which is the ability to execute custom code during window creation to make changes to window handles. Windows can also be created from raw window handles.
Of course, it is also possible to use the window as-is without making any changes.
See the example for more details.
